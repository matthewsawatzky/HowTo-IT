## ‚úÖ Quick Start

This installs a CMD tool called ####toit

```bash
curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/matthewsawatzky/HowTo-IT/main/install-toit.sh -o /tmp/install-toit.sh \
  && bash /tmp/install-toit.sh
source ~/.bashrc
```

To install a package from this repo just run:

```bash
toit xxx-setup.sh
```

To Delete ####toit#### juts run:

```bash
toit removeyourself
```

If you have another program that uses the command ####toit#### then you will have to use the command:

```bash
h2it <command>
```
